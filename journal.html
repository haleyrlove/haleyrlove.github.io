            <p>I found Jeffrey Daley's portfolio super fun to look through. I really love how streamlined and easy to use it was- every page had a way to easily go backwards, forwards, escape content, and return to the home-page method which was really effective. I also really loved the general design of his portfolio. It had a lot of character to it, yet it still had a professional way of laying out his work in a concise matter that was easy to digest. I almost want to follow his example as a way to redo my own portfolio website if I ever get the time, because it has a perfect balance between quirky, simplistic, and professional. How awesome!</p>

        <h4>Homework for February 20th</h4>

        <p>For the first website I'd do over, it'd definitely have to be the website for Growers Outlet in Portland. They're a local family run business that I actually am a cashier and stock clerk for, and it's a great place to buy produce that's sourced from local farmers in the Oregon, Washington, and upper Californian area. While their produce is amazing, their website is super lackluster and looks like it was made in the early 2000s. One of the main things I would change would have to be the fonts used throughout the website. What they're using currently looks kind of like a default arial, and they use it throughout the entire website which makes the whole thing look boring and computer generated. I would also adjust the layout of information, because everything is very static and repetitive- it just doesn't make you actually want to read the information they have on the screen. Lastly I would definitely adjust the types of pictures they're using on each page, because they have these massive feature images and some of them look so low quality that you can count every single pixel the photo has. It's a website that definitely needs a little love and personality...  </p>

        <p>For the second website I'd totally do over, it'd be for a local business called CereusPDX. It's a really yummy cocktail lounge that's paired with Colombian and Peruvian food that makes for a DELICIOUS experience. While their food and drinks are really good, their website is pretty mid. On mobile it looks decent, but on a laptop or PC it looks a little clunky and awkard. The header and navigation take up a lot of the page, and you can tell that some of the text coloring is really low contrast-so not great in accesibility. So I would definitely make revisions to the homepage and the types of colors that they'e using to style the site. Like the Growers Outlet website I would also make sure to reorganize the general website layout because it's boring and a little standard for like a default template site.  </p>

        <h2>Club Penguin</h2>

        <p>I decided to reminisce about Club Penguin because I used to play it allll the time in elementary school. It was to the point that I would ask for giftcards so that I could trick out my penguin with cool clothes and have a cool igloo house full of pets. Looking back, I think the early 2005-2007 website was really iconic in it's design. It always had this signature blue background and buttons with white all capital text that resembled comic sans. Otherwise all the text looked like it was in some generic Arial font. It was iconic because of how nostalgic it was, and it's interesting to know that even if the website itself wasn't the most well put together- all kids cared about was the game content. </p>

    <h4>Homework for January 30th</h4>
    <p>For my project one website, I was interested in creating an informational site about gachapon machines. Gachapon (ガチャポン), also known as gashapon (ガシャポン), are toy dispensers in Japan that resemble Western toy vending machines. You insert a coin, usually between 100 to 500 yen, and turn the handle to release a capsule.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I'm interested in this topic because I'm going to Japan this year, and I've always been excited over collectibles and toy machines. I think it'll be something fun that people don't really think about. There's no particular website I'm modeling after, I just know that I want something colorful and engaging, because that's my style.</p>

        <p>I love the subtle motion on this site, suchas when you mouse over the images
            and they have a subtle varying perspective. I also appreciate the images that appear and dissapear
            upon scrolling. It's really smooth and feels very sophisticated when you're scrolling through
            their website. </p>

        <h2>Did you know that a group of frogs is called an army?</h2>
        
        <p>Like an army, large groups of frogs come together during breeding season to search for food.
             Moving in a large group provides frogs with an increased chance of survival. </p>
